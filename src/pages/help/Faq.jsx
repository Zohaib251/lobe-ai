            Lobe is a free, private desktop application that has everything you
            need to take your machine learning ideas from prototype to
            production.

            Machine learning is software that learns to perform a task from a

            defining rules and formulas. This learning software is called a{" "}

            A model is a piece of code. You can export your model into a variety
            of industry-standard formats to run on Mac and Windows, the web, or
            mobile and edge devices. You can also export and use your model in{" "}

            <span className="underline mx-1">GitHub</span> for sample projects
            and other tools for working with Lobe. We are also working on a
            collection of apps and integrations to help run your model without
            any code.

            Yes, all of your images and models stay private on your computer.
            Lobe runs and trains machine learning models entirely on your own
            device. Your project images and models are never uploaded to the
            cloud or visible to us.
